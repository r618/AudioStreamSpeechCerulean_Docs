The asset is a user friendly Unity interface for basic speech recognition and synthesis parts of Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK hosted on Azure platform
    - for speech services overview please see https://speech.microsoft.com/portal

Microsoft Cognitive Service Speech SDK is distributed with the asset and latest version can be downloaded from https://aka.ms/csspeech/unitypackage
    - SDK is hosted at https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk 
    - please refer also to 
        https://github.com/Azure-Samples/cognitive-services-speech-sdk/tree/master/quickstart/csharp/unity/text-to-speech

All components use subscription key and region for authentication currently *only*

( please refer to Azure documentation on how to create needed Resource group and Speech service;
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started-speech-to-text, resp.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started-text-to-speech also point to required Azure resources
)

Subscription Key and Region values can be set on each respective component, OR alternatively -
if 'SPEECH_KEY' and 'SPEECH_REGION' environment variables are set, their values will be used for authentication instead.

After setting all/needed properties, either set 'Auto Start', or call .StartSpeech() via scripting to run the component,
standard Unity events are used for all notifications afterwards.

It's possible to supply your own SpeechRecognizer / SpeechSynthesizer as a parameter to .StartSpeech(...);
All custom settings on the component are then ignored since the whole respective config is provided as part of the custom configuration.

Please also refer to demo scenes and 'AudioStreamSpeechCerulean_SpeechRecognition' and 'AudioStreamSpeechCerulean_SpeechSynthesis' for more

Note: currently only base scenarios of Synthesis and Recognition parts of the SDK are covered - for more, such as batch transcription, custom speech recognition,
custom voices,... , please use SDK directly.
